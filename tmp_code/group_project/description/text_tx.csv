We have decided not to take her back to Botanical Gardens as we have grown very attached to her and do not want her to go back to her old condition.

Unfortunately, we already have three dogs of which two are rescue dogs also so can't take her in. Therefore, we need to find a loving HOME for her. Goldie is already an adult female - we don't know how old. She has a lovely brown coat with eyes that will melt your heart. She's very very calm and of good temperament. In all the time we've known her, she has never barked and would happily come when called. She also loves dry dog food. We've taken a couple of pictures of her - which is very difficult as she's always chasing imaginary flies - she's so used to keeping flies off her back ! - Can some KIND SOUL out there please make room in your HOME for this lovely dog who will love you unconditionally.

(my next door neighbour threw a fit when they arrived at their shoe rack first before mine.)

Not vaccinated yet either, pls take note. RM50 is just to help me cover cost for the cat items i've purchased. It's worth much much more than RM50 all put together. I will be giving the food/water bowl, scratch post and pad and DIY litter box and food (if any). These cats can be picked up anytime. Just give me a buzz.

I can't keep the kittens because I have 2 to take care of with no mother. The Kittens are still nursing, and scared but does not bite or scratch. If anyone is interested in adopting them, please email me and tell me about your experiences with cats. Right now, they are staying upstairs, in the balcony outside. I provide them a cage, but opened. Mum cat will not stay calm in the cage, so I decided to leave it open for her. The little ones sleep inside and Coda sleeps outside. [Update] It's impossible to adopt the kittens now. They are still afraid of human contact. Especially the Calico and Black/white one. They are still nursing with their mother. They can't eat on their own yet. I'll give it 3-4 weeks before they are separated from mummy. I would prefer if all 3 of them are adopted together. I've decided to give them names so it's easier to update. The Golden is Hal. [Male] The Black/white is Joe. [Male] The Calico is Sasa. [Female] [Update] Hal is starting to respond to me when I call him and when I come out to give food. Sasa will roll over but she's scared to come close. Joe will come near if he smells food, and does not mind me petting him. Sasa's fur is so much longer now. All their fur is beautiful and thicker. I will upload more pictures soon. [Update] All of them are good eaters now. Not as scared as before. When I open the door to give them food, they run to me instead of running away. That's a good thing, they are beginning to trust me. I think soon they'll be ready. It's urgent now because I might be out of the country next month. I really need to find someone to adopt them. I can't put them for boarding because they have fleas, and I have 2 other kittens I have to board. That's all the updates for now. [Update] I only want people who are serious to email/message me. A lot of people emailed me and gave me and the kittens hope of finding a home for them, but after sometime they don't reply. I only want what's best for them.

He is a good looking and clean dog and we knew he must belong to someone and sure enough we found his fur around his neck was flattened where he had worn a collar for some time. His injury was causing him great pain and we can only assume that his owner abandoned him to avoid costly vet bills. We managed to gain his trust and took him to the vet for treatment. Sadly the vet diagnosed that the injury was too bad to save the leg and amputation was the best option. The newly named ""Nolan"" went through the operation and recovered amazingly well, in fact the vet told us that after such a major operation he was suprised at how well Nolan has recovered and how healthy he is. Nolan is really happy now that the pain has gone and is very lively and acts and behaves as if 3 legs are better than 4! He tries to show that he can do anything a 4 legged dog can do and do it better! He loves his walks and obviously misses human company as he is always asking for strokes and hugs and giving back kisses and licks. He has gone through an awful lot in his life and after going through so much pain and heartache after being injured and abandoned he really deserves a loving and secure home to live in. He would make a great family pet and would fill any home with love and fun and at the same time still be able to keep it and the family safe and secure!

Handphone:- This past Wednesday as we went out to feed the parrent adult dogs, they were so happy to see us as usually with big waiving tails. I heard all the puppies down some stairs which heads to a waterway. One of the puppies had fallen down toward the waterway and couldn't get back up. So we went to go fetch him. With the help of my friend, I slid down the muddy side and got the cute little puppy and handy him up to safe ground and my friend then helped pull me up. Momma and puppy were very happy. Over the next few days, we started bringing food for the puppies. The puppies devour the food and Momma dogs seems to be happy we are there now to feed her puppies.

Both neutered n vaccinated. Apparently they have been guarding d construction site for more than 5yrs now. I was told that d manager brought them to d site as guard dogs. He had since left d company n left d dogs behind. So d security guard took care of them. Shared his food n shed with them. Since most of d buildings r completed now they didn't want d dogs anymore. They contacted d dog catchers n took them away. After 4 long days...i managed to find out where they were. The very next day..i paid the fine and took them out. At the moment they are boarding at the vet clinic. Mus & Libby are very obedient n gentle. They love being around humans.

He was fearful but hunger got the best of him and he bravely came near us for a bit of my husband's pie. There was a Jaya Grocer nearby so I dashed there and bought 2 pouches of cat food. While he was gobbling up the first packet, my husband ask ""So are you going to catch it and get it snipped? Better decide now before it gets full and runs off."" Typically, I don't rescue cats who are not in need of help (i.e. not injured) and I trap-neuter-release stray cats whom I've fed for a while and am familiar with. But Chester seemed manageable to catch so I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and took him back to our place. ~Vet Visit - 27 Feb ~ Took Chester to the vet today, with the intention of getting him neutered. At the beginning, I'd thought Chester was female (I didn't get to check him out closely) so the vet enlightened me and informed me that he's male :P And for male cats, it is not recommended to neuter them too early so that their urinary tubes can develop so that they have a lesser chance of getting urinary issues later in life. The vet recommends male cats to be neutered around 10 months or older. This is a new thing I learned today because I'd thought all cats can be neutered from 6 months and above. Well, it can be done, just not recommended. (Note: The urinary issue does not affect female cats) Chester is estimated to be about 5 months old now. Unfortunately, I can't keep him for another 5 months before getting him neutered. So I am boarding him at the vet for the next 2 weeks to try to find him a home, failing which, I will neuter him and release him. Chester is not an aggressive cat. He is fearful of strangers and hisses, which is totally normal, but he does not bite or scratch. Once you softly pat his head, he calms down and stops hissing. Conditions for adoption: 1. Ideally to be an indoor-only cat. This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Commit to neuter him at 10 months. Those who are interested to adopt Chester MUST commit to neuter him because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. It also prevents him from spraying around your house and prevents certain health conditions (Google on benefits of neutering cats). 3. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on his progress until he is neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to Chester's adoption: De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. Serious adopters only.

He had a rough start, with breathing difficulties that had him hospitalized for about a week and also malnourished. He didn't have energy to be the typical hyper kitten when he was first rescued. Now, he's full of energy and waiting for his forever home! Are you the one to be his forever family? Conditions for Brownie's adoption: 1. To be kept indoors-only so that he won't encounter the same situation as he was in when he was first rescued. Also, it prevents him from getting into altercations with other animals or open to abuse by humans. 2. To be neutered when he is of age. This is MANDATORY so that he doesn't add to the stray overpopulation. A RM neuter deposit will be collected from adopter, refundable upon proof of receipt of his neutering from your vet of choice. [Note: I have put in place this condition for all the kittens I have previously rescued and rehomed, and I am very thankful to note that their new guardians have all complied and refunds have been made to them as per the condition] 3. I will get his vaccination done but kittens need 3 initial doses. Depending on when he finds his forever home, if he has not completed the 3 doses, the adopter is to bring him for his subsequent dose(s) to complete it. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on his progress until he is neutered. [Note: Regular being once every few weeks; not daily or weekly unless the adopter wishes to do so] Brownie is currently being boarded at my vet in Puchong.

Details of their rescue can be found here: Hope is a very calm and good-natured dog. He was one of the first dogs that caught my eye when I was at the pound, and I remembered thinking that he would make a good family pet because of his calm and friendly nature. The vet suspects he is either a lost or abandoned dog due to his good nature. He also seems to walk reasonably well on the leash. Hope is currently under quarantine at the vet to ensure he has not contracted any diseases while at the pound. He will also be dewormed, deflea-ed, deticked, vaccinated and neutered before he goes to his new home. If you are looking for a quiet, gentle and calm dog to be an addition to your family, Hope is the perfect candidate! My only conditions are: 1. To keep him within your house compound and not to let him roam so that he doesn't get into the danger of being hit by vehicles, get lost or risk getting abused by other people. 2. Not to keep him chained up or locked up in a cage majority of the time because this is no life for a dog, or for any living being for that matter. 3.

Next up is getting them vaccinated and corresponding quarantine period to ensure they're not harbouring any hidden illnesses. They're so far active and healthy, with good appetites. My vet says they are in too good condition to be strays, hence a stronger suspicion that they may have been abandoned. I'm still trying to find them a home where they can be together because they are so attached to each other (we suspect they're siblings), although I am not closed to the idea of getting them adopted separately if really need be. Please do consider adopting them together and give them a second chance at having a family. Adoption conditions: 1. Love them and respect them as you would treat any other person (treat them like how you would like to be treated), provide them access to clean water, healthy food, medical treatments and most of all, give them love and attention. 2. A meet-up between potential adopter and the dogs would be recommended so both can meet each other and see if there's chemistry. 3. Allow occasional visitations so I may see how the adopter and dogs are doing. This will only be once in a while as I respect your privacy. An adoption fee would apply to cover some of their medical expenses. ~Original Post~ I very recently spotted Fred and Ginger near my parents' place. They were not there before, so they must have only just been dumped. Why I suspect that they're dumped pets? They display the following characteristics: 1. They have been in the same spot, out in the open, looking like they're waiting for their owner to return for them. Based on my observation of typical strays, they don't like to be out in the open and prefer to hide, coming out only when they need to look for food. 2. They are friendly; they came right up to me when I got down from my car. Again, looking like they were expecting their owner to come pick them up and take them home. They let me pet them and did not shy away from me at all. Typical strays would just run away when I even step out of my car and will only touch the food after I have driven off. The area where they are at is not safe for them because the people there may call the local council to catch them anytime because they are not stray-friendly at all. And given that Fred and Ginger stay out in the open, they make their presence known because people can see them whenever they pass by. I don't know how old they are, I am just guesstimating that they're around 1-2 years old. Please note that they are NOT purebred German Shepherds but they look like they have some mix of GS in them. They are medium sized, with somewhat short legs (reminds me of basset hounds). Put these features together and you get awesomely cute mixed breeds! I am willing to get them neutered, spayed and vaccinated before they go to their new homes. That is what the adoption fee will go towards. Please find it in your heart to give them a second chance at a home. They've already been dumped once (I suspect); please give them a second chance. If possible, do adopt them together because they are such a lovely couple! (see photo) They don't have much time; I would like to get them off the streets as soon as possible before the people call the local council on them.

I responded to the call for assistance and took them to the vet for a checkup and treatment. When they were first brought in to the vet, they were down with flu. Their other litter mate had such severe flu that it destroyed her eyes so she's now blind. Fortunately, I managed to find someone to adopt her and she will be headed to Penang to her forever home. Mika and Milo now need homes as well. They've recovered from their flu and are active and eating well. We're not sure of Milo's (gray/white) gender yet because they're barely a month old but Mika (the black/yellow one) is definitely female based on her color. They have been deflea-ed and dewormed but are not old enough to be vaccinated yet (vaccination at 2 months) Mika and Milo can be adopted individually or together. They are currently boarded at my vet's clinic in Ara Damansara and I can deliver them to their new home within Klang Valley. Conditions for adoption: 1. To be indoor-only cats. This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are of age(female 5-6 months; male 10 months). Those who are interested to adopt the kittens MUST commit to spaying or neutering them when they reach minimum age because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. There will be a RM deposit required for each kitten, which will be refunded upon proof of spaying/neutering. 3. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered. I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. Serious adopters only.

Sadly my house if full of rescued and traumatised animals at the moment (the monsoon makes it much worse for stays), and these guys mostly recovered and ready to move on. Pls help spread? Thank you for your compassion ♥",0.3298511764666513,-0.06176315374719735,0.10144095030995041,0.05786102694827583,-0.00045132854279690906,0.11654149114081049,0.0872687540198746,0.14177644084437713,0.004582175942437511,0.1120086647849917,117

We went over and rescued her yesterday (4 April) and we're looking for a good permanent home for her. Both of us cant keep her as I'm based outstation now and my friend already has 4 doggies at home. She has good temperament and is very very very friendly and sayang. She loves car rides and loves to cuddle up with you to sleep. We've cleaned her and are feeding her good food now so she's on her way to perfect health. We are unsure of her actual age but recon she may be about 1 year. Please do contact us if you're able to give this darling girl a good home. Thanks Grace",0.4750572216343173,-0.07587282173568415,-0.11909903801548714,-0.030369677847213453,-0.16888820660808185,-0.23231644317145275,-0.05609194208879355,-0.05329806631188013,-0.10505701467274059,0.02572126042492322,172

They are now coming to 15 weeks old, and are cat litter box trained and eating solid food. They have been dewormed twice and received their SECOND of THREE vaccinations last week. There is no adoption fee, but potential adopter(s) must agree to neuter them when they are nearing 6 months old and follow up with their vaccinations. These affectionate and playful precious four are looking for loving forever homes. We are hoping to find them homes in pairs.

If both could be adopted in the same home, it'll be great, but can be adopted separately. 2 cans of food and a bag of cat litter will be given to the adopters so that the kitten can adjust slowly to their new home. We are located around Damansara and are willing to travel to Bangsar, Taman Tun, and Hartamas. Please email us for now. Thank you so much for giving them a kind and loving home! **note:they were in another profile (), but they were not adopted because the prospective adopters didn't reply back. Their other brother and sister were adopted by very lovely and nice people. :)",0.3197471950646118,-0.044424594694046755,0.18108580296590518,-0.019847145502719776,0.07337955338476179,-0.09854435399574518,0.03523940485049736,0.033977366931527996,-0.030794283900145897,-0.09595053526698474,186

At that moment of time the cat was still as lively as ever, seemingly ignorant of its injuries. However last wednesday I found the cat lying weak and limping from a seemingly broken paw, although its wounds were beginning to heal slightly. From accounts of some students, some have witnessed the cat being victim to dog attacks. My friend and I got it to the vet in Semenyih, but unfortunately it was closed. We applied iodine onto its wounds, and I kept it in my room for a few days.I took it back home to PJ in the weekends, and sought help. From diagnosis, the cat was probably ran over more than once by vehicles judging from its injuries, and the fracture is more severe than initially thought of. The cat has fractured/dislocated its shoulder, and it has begin to ossify, which means the bone is beginning to heal in an abnormal position. The cat will be lame for the rest of its life if not corrected, and this will render it defenseless as it hinders its movement (it can only hop now, and tends to lose balance and fall). The bone is now jutting out from the side. The vet recommended surgery as its nerve endings are still intact, in which a pin will be placed in the shoulder to help correct it. However, whether the cat will be able to use the leg after surgery will depend on the impact of the surgery on its nerves. If the surgery is performed after the bone heals in that abnormal position, the bone will have to be broken again to insert the pin. The surgery costs more a thousand ringgit. The vet says if surgery is decided against the cat has to be kept indoors as it is unable to protect itself or hunt for food. I am unable to pay for its medical cost due to financial problems. I have been taking care of the cat in my room. I cannot bring the cat back to my house because my dad has suppressed immunity as a result of chemotherapy, and I am beginning to wheeze as I keep the cat in such a confined space. I have brought the cat to PAWS, the most lenient of all animal shelters to see if they can rehome the cat, but according to policy if the cat has a broken leg it will be promptly put to sleep. I hope the students can help the cat out by: 1. Contributing a little to its medical fees 2. Adopt the cat, or at least look after it. The cat is clean, sensible, uses the cat litter well, very sociable and is not hostile towards other cats. It is pretty vocal and clingy though. I really need your help. The photo is a misrepresentation of its injuries, we mistakenly bandaged the paw thinking the paw is fractured. It also hides all its flesh wounds from view. Contact number:",5a9356966,1.0,"A week ago, I found the cat marred with bleeding flesh wounds all over its body. At that moment of time the cat was still as lively as ever, seemingly ignorant of its injuries. However last wednesday I found the cat lying weak and limping from a seemingly broken paw, although its wounds were beginning to heal slightly. From accounts of some students, some have witnessed the cat being victim to dog attacks. My friend and I got it to the vet in Semenyih, but unfortunately it was closed. We applied iodine onto its wounds, and I kept it in my room for a few days.I took it back home to PJ in the weekends, and sought help. From diagnosis, the cat was probably ran over more than once by vehicles judging from its injuries, and the fracture is more severe than initially thought of. The cat has fractured/dislocated its shoulder, and it has begin to ossify, which means the bone is beginning to heal in an abnormal position. The cat will be lame for the rest of its life if not corrected, and this will render it defenseless as it hinders its movement (it can only hop now, and tends to lose balance and fall). The bone is now jutting out from the side. The vet recommended surgery as its nerve endings are still intact, in which a pin will be placed in the shoulder to help correct it. However, whether the cat will be able to use the leg after surgery will depend on the impact of the surgery on its nerves. If the surgery is performed after the bone heals in that abnormal position, the bone will have to be broken again to insert the pin. The surgery costs more a thousand ringgit. The vet says if surgery is decided against the cat has to be kept indoors as it is unable to protect itself or hunt for food. I am unable to pay for its medical cost due to financial problems. I have been taking care of the cat in my room.

I'm now living with a fosterer, who has a German Shepherd mix and unfortunately we're not getting along very well. I also prefer to be inside because of my sensitive skin (my current fosterer can't put me inside). If you have it in your heart, please bring me in. I am very easy to please. I will only sleep beside or near you most of the time and I don't require much of a walk (only enough to do my business outside).

Either way, the previous owners must have been real losers and may God have mercy on them. I've grown so fond of Forest in the past few weeks that I've cared for him. He is now vaccinated and dewormed. Sadly, he still lives outside as a stray as my parents would not allow another dog in the house. Forest lives outside my gate in a flimsy ""house"" of umbrellas.

She is clearly another abandon case as I have never saw her for the past year. Throughout the period I kept her in my stall I realize she has trouble breathing normally and again I immediately brought her to the vet for a check up. The vet suspected it may be pheumonia or hernia and treatment was given immediately. She responded well to the treatment but further check up(ultrasound)is required in order to get back her health. Reason for giving her up for adoption is because she doesn't seems happy staying in my house as I have another dog that constantly stressing her out and she lost her freedom. I have no choice but to keep her in my room for her sake while I out for work.

She is clearly another abandon case as I have never saw her for the past year. Throughout the period I kept her in my stall I realize she has trouble breathing normally and again I immediately brought her to the vet for a check up. The vet suspected it may be pheumonia or hernia and treatment was given immediately. She responded well to the treatment but further check up(ultrasound)is required in order to get back her health. Reason for giving her up for adoption is because she doesn't seems happy staying in my house as I have another dog that constantly stressing her out and she lost her freedom. I have no choice but to keep her in my room for her sake while I out for work.

I'm also returning to my home country shortly and looking for new home for those lovely cats. - They're bigger than normal domestic shorthair cats. But don't let the size full you. They're all very gentle and loving. :) - They take bathe quite good. Not once I got scratched while I'm bathing them (even some friendly, breed cats scratch you during bathe). -I'm not very sure about cats' age. They're all 2,3 years and above. 1. Boe (Female, neutered) She is very, very friendly to people, even to strangers. Playful and very cute. You'd know she's a female from looking her acting. :) 2. Mochi (Male, sprayed, vaccinated) When you look at mochi you would be reminded of Garfield the cat. He's a chubby cat but also likes to play with toys. 3. Pea (Male, sprayed, vaccinated) This beautiful cat is quite big but he is the most gentle cat I ever seen. He's shy but opens up easily to women. When he does he gives you kitty massage. Green eyed and gray colored pattern are not very normal for domestic cats. 4. Shorty (Male, sprayed) Shorty's name is for his short tail. He used to be abused before he came to my friend, so he gets easily scared especially by men. He reacts better for women but it still takes time for him to open up. Still, he doesn't attack anyone, if he's really scared he just hisses, that's all. He's one shy but lovely cat and sometimes surprise you with cute friendliness once he knows you're a good person. All you need to do is to give him enough time to settle and to know no one is abusing him anymore. 5. Tols (Male, sprayed) This one is a cat that acts like a dog. He likes to stay on your lap and follows you around. Very playful and fun. I think he's one of the rare cats who actually enjoy bathe (but only in warm water ;) ).

After awhile I grew very fond of him because he's such a doll and I felt sorry for him for not having a home of his own. He's generally a good cat. Very affectionate and likes to be around people. He'll come running when you call his name. I think he would make a fabulous pet and companion. He is able to co-exist with my female cats without much fuss. The reason why I need to find a new home for him is because he doesn't get along with my male cat. I recently castrated him (my cat) and now Soya bullies him. He is very lovable and loves to be petted. He's not a fussy eater either and makes a good outdoor cat as well as an indoor cat. If you're interested please let me know. But I only want a responsible animal lover and not a so-so owner for him. I need to know that he'll be well cared for and not neglected later on. Edit: Although I think he would do fine indoors but I would like him to have a home where he is allowed access to the outside world. Preferably with a lawn. I have also added some more pictures of him so you can have a better idea of how he looks like. Edit2: The person who decided to take him changed her mind. Soya is still up for adoption. If you feel you can give him a good life please email me or sms me asap.

The reason why I need to find a new home for him is because he doesn't get along with my male cat. I recently castrated him (my cat) and now Soya bullies him. He is very lovable and loves to be petted. He's not a fussy eater either and makes a good outdoor cat as well as an indoor cat. If you're interested please let me know. But I only want a responsible animal lover and not a so-so owner for him. I need to know that he'll be well cared for and not neglected later on. Edit: Although I think he would do fine indoors but I would like him to have a home where he is allowed access to the outside world. Preferably with a lawn. I have also added some more pictures of him so you can have a better idea of how he looks like. Edit2: The person who decided to take him changed her mind. Soya is still up for adoption. If you feel you can give him a good life please email me or sms me asap.

I was outside with my cats, just enjoying the afternoon air. I saw him peeking from outside the gate at my cat Angie. Then he saw my foster kittens running around. He jumped inside. He looked harmless and so I let him be. I didn't think he would stick around but I was wrong. He is so very tame and affectionate which causes me to believe that he is someone's cat. But he was so skinny so I suspected that he was lost. The odd thing was that he looked at me like he knew who I was but I have never seen him around before. He even went about approaching my cats like he was family and was none too shy to attempt play with the kittens. It appears to be that he came from a multiple cat household/family. He stayed for 2 days and wouldnt leave. Fearing that someone might be looking for it, my mom and I decided to place him at this one area where we believed he might have originated from (considering several factors) in hopes that he would find his way home. Surprisingly, after a day he found his way back to my house! This prompted me to think that he may have ran away instead of gotten lost because he had found his way back to my place (I took him to that other area by car and at night so he couldn't have known the route- or so I thought). I surely hope that he wasn't abandoned by his previous owner and that is why he refuses to go home. I tried looking around for his owner but nobody seems to know where he came from. He's a very dear and loving cat. Likes to brush against people's legs and is obviously familiar with humans and other pet cats. He's not stunningly beautiful but he's got a soft friendly face and a BIG nose! =p. C'mon, Barbara Streisand has a huge nose and she's adored by many! Since no one has come forward to claim him and he wants to be someone's furkid, I've decided to put him up for adoption to anyone willing to give him a loving home. Unfortunately I cannot keep/foster him myself because I have reached full capacity for cats at my home for the time being. So I do not have the space nor the means to care for him. Adoption fees are for precautionary measures to make sure he doesn't get any joy/irresponsible adopters. He will be vaccinated and dewormed with that money. Strictly for animal lovers only who believe in the act of neutering. IF I can find donations to neuter him first I will do that before he goes to a new home. If not, you must promise to neuter him. He MUST be a FREE ROAMING cat either indoor, outdoor or both. I do not agree in caging animals unless for safety purposes or temporary health issues so if you plan to keep him in a cage 24/7, I'm sorry I will have to say no. Please understand that I will ask questions to see if you are suitable for the cat. It is not that I want to be unreasonable or difficult but I want what is best for the cat. Those interested please contact me preferably through email. Better yet, if this is your cat or you know the owner of this cat please let me know. Hopefully with sound proof that he belongs to you or that someone you know.

Will really appreciate it if someone will adopt and provide her with a good loving home. She is such a beautiful loving puppy and really deserves it. Our location is in Johor Bahru city area.

So this 'young' ciku is looking for love again. He deserves a good home after all he has been through. _______________________________________________ This old boy was abandoned in SPCA. Most likely due to his age. Thorough blood test (including heartworm) were done by private vet. He's certified healthy & in fact he doesn't look like 10 (must be the botox ;-)) The only tell tale sign is he has a few teeth left. He has been given an annual jab for heartworm and I'll get him vaccinated & neutered as well. What I know about this fella - * excellent temperament * good with kids especially young ones * still playful * has a 'territory marking' problem (can be fixed with lotsa of love and patience) * not toilet trained (again can be taught through consistent routine) I am hoping that someone with a big heart can take him in and let him feel loved again. It's not easy for an old dog to get a second chance. In fact his chance would have run out if I didn't take him out of SPCA & foster him. That special someone ideally should have some experience with dogs bcoz points 4 & 5. Most importantly he/she should stick with / by him through thick & thin.

I am looking for people to adopt these 2 female dogs, Jane (black and brown) and Julia (white with black specks). They are currently approximately 3-4 months old. The sisters were adopted 2 months ago. I found them in a box at the market. Death was knocking on Julia's door due to a viral infection but I sent her to the vet for a few days and nursed her back to health, and now she is the more active of the pair. Both Jane and Julia are very smart puppies, learning to recognise their own names merely just after 1 week! They are loving and friendly dogs, and like to lick their owners when they are out from their cage. They are potty trained to pee and poop on newspapers (so don't leave any new newspapers/magazines lying around!). Also, they understand simple commands like ""come in"", ""go out"", ""NO!"" (as long as you teach them where is ""in"" and ""out""). Julia is a very smart and curious dog, likes exploring the surrounding and trying out new stuffs. On the other hand, Jane is the contrast of Julia. Keeping more to herself, she is very obedient and more gentle, a huge contrast to her sibling. Though the two dogs are opposites of each other, they love each other, and more importantly their owners very much. I am looking for people who would like to adopt them as I already have 2 dogs in my place and we don't have the time and resources to take care of them. Though they may be mixed breed, they are good and loyal dogs and I hope that you would kindly take them in as a family. I can be contacted at (Madam Lee).

Unfortunately she jumps and fights with most dogs she sees, including those that are much, MUCH larger than her. BUT I LOVE HER ALL THE SAME!!! P.S: I am only guessing her breeds, the lady we adopted her from didn't know either... she's a mix!My uncle said she had Wolf blood(truthfully!), I think vampire! she tried to bite my cousin's dog on the neck a few months ago!!",0.2423912465663808,-0.0067051323118503285,-0.07971860359054474,-0.17509944572354946,0.08737756600378667,0.06802720675394727,0.10737398239376095,0.02163423604977455,-0.008674620518430622,0.02788067658573051,111

Follows you everywhere you go. She is very close with Tiger. Note: She will need to some time to get used to new environment as she has always been at home with us. 2) Tiger (grey/black color). Tiger is a male. He is the most timid of them. Also very manja. Love to have his chin and head scratched. He likes to climb and sit on your lap or tummy. Tiger should be able to get along fine with any other cats. He is close with Muffin. 3) Gingy (orange/white color). She is more independent and afraid of new people/environment.

The puppy itself is actually very cute and quite energetic for people out there who loves to be around outdoor. The reason for me to post this ad is because I'm a uni student currently having my sem break and I'm afraid that my Dad might abandon the dog somewhere near the factories or worse at the construction company that he is working in. The environment near the construction itself is worse, and the Vietnamese and Myanmar foreign workers have been known to slaughter stray dogs including those around the construction sites for protein as they couldn't afford any meat. Puppies like these will be killed for their meats. I have no doubts of this. I'm seriously hoping to look for a new owner for this pup before my new semester kick starts. To be honest I don't think that my puppy's skin infection is serious, as I believe it can be dealt with if the puppy have medical attention. The puppy itself is not aggressive and he's a bit shy but once you get to know him, you'll love him. Please, someone, adopt this poor dog before it ends up on someone's plate.

She has been a great company, very friendly to friends and family and is super cute when she hears a loud noise and starts hiding in the corner. We are having more commitments and limited by time constraint. Otherwise, she would be a perfect companion that we would love to keep.",0.36877655629626,-0.04026675023346548,-0.12113102101159147,-0.3159784460040397,0.034815969603183464,0.14022505973764868,-0.013392024750540573,-0.0055484172474979665,0.02767059630471919,0.17519503236874973,104

Before that, here are some information on them. The momma cat is Tachi, she's about 8-9 months old. She's a momma cat to the 4 kittens. The first one is Bieber. He is the whitest of all. He's shy and a bit scared of strangers. But he's the handsome one :) The second one is Koko. He's the brownish of all. He's a bit fierce when he's hungry. He got defensive easily but he is absolutely adorable and loves to play. He got some spot/dots near his mouth, on his lips. The third one is sweet Shizu. She's a girly girl. The only one of them 4 that loves to clean herself. She got lean body, short hair and very neat baby girl. And the little one of all is Little Oyo. We named him that because of all 4, he was the smallest in size and shapes. And he's different, he got black spots on his body, and he's the most friendly and ""manja"" of all. And he's not scared of anything. We've got to find new home for Bieber and his 2 brothers, Oyo and Koko, and his sister Shizu. I brought the kitten to a vet for fleas, and the vet told me that the kitten is a mix of domestic + siamese + persian. The kitten is the case of accidental pregnancy. We were planning on neutering his mother, Tachi but we got beaten by the male stray cat. She was a baby and we didn't expect the male cat would break into our home and do her. sobs. poor Tachi. Nonetheless, we still love the kitten, but we don't have space, time and funds to take care all of them, so we're trying our very best to find a good home for them. We hope if anyone of you out there could adopt them, do let me know and contact me. Thank you for your time and consideration.",a691ef2a1,6.0,"Hi everyone.
