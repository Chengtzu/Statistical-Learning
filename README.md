## Final Project: Pet Finder

## Kaggle Competition

## HW1: KNN model
We are going to use a subset of the "Million Songs Dataset" in this question. The dataset has been pre-processed and the training and testing dataset has been splitted and stored in a dictionary data structure. You can load the data from msd_data1.pickle using pickle.load(). There are four elements in the dictionary: X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test. As indicated by their names, these four elements are training and testing data. The outcome variable (i.e.  y ) is the year a song was released, and the features are variables that characterize the sound of a song. The goal is to predict the release year given sound features.
